* Concepts

    * Basic Expression templates modeled after the Blaze library.
    * No need to make it too "smart" : Blaze handles that load
    * Need to make it variadic to handle many number of disjointly
    evolving "states" : any dependence should come from the kernels
    * LICENSE : BSD, from blaze
    * TODO : Make it official (include blaze's headers etc.) in every file.
